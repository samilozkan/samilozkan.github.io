### Hi I'm Şamil 👋🏼

I am Data Scientist at Global Stuctured Finance(UK). I am skilled in data analysis, data science, hypothesis testing, machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms and optimization, Python, and R programming language.

I have been fascinated by data science, increasingly quantitative nature decision-making; I am dedicated to stay up to date with the newest technologies and analytic techniques that I mentioned before.

I have excellent analytical skills and good relationship with people. I am also self-motivated, responsible, and highly organized and enjoy mining solutions from data and people.
