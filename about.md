### Hi I'm Şamil 👋🏼

I am a data engineer. I am skilled in data analysis, data engineering, build a ELT/ETL pipeline with data orchestiration tools like airflo, dbt etc.

I have been fascinated by data impact, increasingly quantitative nature decision-making; I am dedicated to stay up to date with the newest technologies and analytic techniques that I mentioned before.

I have excellent analytical skills and good relationship with people. I am also self-motivated, responsible, and highly organized and enjoy mining solutions from data and people.
